Python:
========
Guido Van Rossum is the creator of the Python programming language.
He developed Python in the late 1980s and released the first version in February 20, 1991

=============
=> IDLE python:
IDLE = Integrated Development and Learning Environment
IDLE is a built-in tool that lets you write, run, and test Python code easily.

======================
=> Features in Python:
1. Functional Programming from C
2. OOP from C++
3. Scripting language features form Perl and shell script
4. Modular programming features from Modula-3

==========
=> Features:
==========
-> 30 keywords in python
-> Freeware & opensource
-> high level programming language
-> Platform independent (write once and run anywhere)
-> Portability (migrate python program from windows to mac)
-> Dynamically typed language - because you don’t need to declare variable types explicitly.
-> Both procedure and object oriented
-> Interpreted - is the program that executes your Python code. ( line by line) -  (no need to compile)
So, Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled one (though it does compile to bytecode internally).
-> Extensible: Python is extensible because it allows integration with other languages like C, C++, and Java,
extending Python’s capabilities beyond its built-in features.
Example: Imagine you have a slow Python loop for a heavy calculation —
you could write that calculation in C, compile it, and then call it in Python:
-> Embedded:
Python is embedded when you use the Python interpreter inside another application.
allowing that application to run Python code internally.
This lets developers use Python as a scripting language inside other software.
-> Extensive library:
Python has a large collection of built-in modules and packages — called the Standard Library,
that provide tools for almost every common programming task.
Because of this extensive (or rich) library, you don’t need to write everything from scratch.


====================
=> Limitations of Python:
====================
1. Performance wise
2. Mobile applications

Myth: It is not sutable for large scale enterprise applications

======================
=> Syntax from C and ABC language

======================
=> where we can use python:
======================
1. Desktop applications
2. web applications
3. Database applications
4. Networking applications
5. Games
6. Data analysis
7. Machine learning
8. AI
9. IOT applications

==================
=> Flavours of Python:
==================
1. CPython - The default and most widely used Python implementation written in C.
2. Jython or JPython - for java
3. IronPython - C#  - Python implemented in .NET framework.
4. Pypy - inside python performance wise - A fast, JIT-compiled version of Python.
5. RubyPython -
6. Anaconda Python - Python distribution focused on data science and scientific computing.
7. Stackless Python - A version of Python that supports microthreads (tasklets) for massive concurrency.

================
=> Python versions:
================
Python 1.0 -  Jan 1994
Python 2.0 - Oct 2000
Python 3.0 - Dec 2008

Latest version - 3.12

-> Any version should provide support for old version programs.
But Python -3 will never provide support to python -2

-> backward compatibility: Python 3 is not backward compatible with Python 2

==============
=> Identifiers:
==============
An identifier is a name given to entities like variables, functions, classes, or objects in Python.
They are used to identify and access data in the program.

-> Must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or underscore (_)
-> Can contain letters, digits, or underscores after the first character
-> Case sensitive
-> Cannot be a Python keyword
-> No special characters or spaces allowed

=> Note:
-> If any identifier starts with 
_(underscore): private
__(double underscore): strongly private
__main__ : language specify identifier

==============
=> In Python, there are several ways to declare variables, 
depending on the type, scope, and purpose. 
==============

-> Python Variable Declaration Methods:
1. Simple Assignment
   x = 10
   name = "Alice"
   pi = 3.14

2. Multiple Assignment
   a, b, c = 1, 2, 3      # different values
   x = y = z = 0           # same value

3. Using Data Structures
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   my_tuple = (10, 20)
   my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
   my_set = {1, 2, 3}

4. Dynamic Typing
   x = 10       # integer
   x = "Hello"  # string
   x = 3.14     # float

5. Using input()
   name = input("Enter name: ")
   age = int(input("Enter age: "))

6. Using globals() / locals()
   globals()['var_name'] = 100
   locals()['temp'] = "Hello"

7. Constants (by convention)
   PI = 3.14159
   MAX_USERS = 100


Use simple assignment for most variables.
Use constants for values that shouldn’t change.
Use multiple assignment for concise code.
   
==============
=> Reserved words:
==============

-> Only 35 reserved words:
False      await      		else       	import     	pass
None       break      	except     in         		raise
True       	class      		finally    	is         		return
and        	continue   	for        	lambda     	try
as         	def        		from       	nonlocal 	while
assert     del        		global    	 not        		with
async     	elif       		if         		or         		yield

Notes:
=====
-> These keywords cannot be used as variable names.
-> Some are for control flow (if, for, while, try, etc.).
-> Others are logical operators (and, or, not).
-> async and await are used for asynchronous programming.

Note:
====
1. only alphabet symbols
2. except first three(True, False, None), all are small 

============
=> Data Types:
============

int 		 		10	 		Integer numbers
float  			3.14		Floating-point numbers
complex		2 + 3j 		 Complex numbers

list			[1, 2, 3]			Ordered, mutable sequence
tuple		(1, 2, 3)			Ordered, immutable sequence
range		range(5)			Sequence of numbers, often in loops

str 				"Hello" 		Sequence of Unicode characters

set				{1, 2, 3}				Mutable, unordered set
frozenset	frozenset({1,2})	Immutable set

dict 		{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}  Mutable key-value pairs

bool 		True / False  	Logical values

NoneType 		None 		Null / no value


Note:
====
-> In python everything is object

==========

=> int:
4 main ways:

1. Decimal (Base 10)
2. Binary (Base 2) – uses digits 0 and 1, prefix 0b or 0B
3. Octal (Base 8) – uses digits 0–7, prefix 0o or 0O
4. Hexadecimal (Base 16) – uses digits 0–9 and letters A–F (or a–f), prefix 0x or 0X

Base				Prefix			Example			Decimal Value
--------				--------			--------				--------
Decimal			None			123					123
Binary				0b				0b1010			10
Octal				0o				0o17				15
Hexadecimal	0x				0x1A				26

ex:
x=10
y=0b10
z=0o10
a=0X10
